# Introduction

Let's uncover **The Mystery behind Python**.

## History of Python

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Van Rossum began developing Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, aiming to address its limitations while maintaining ease of use. The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, reflecting Van Rossum's desire to make programming more enjoyable. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing new features like list comprehensions and garbage collection. In 2008, Python 3.0, a major revision, was launched to fix inconsistencies and improve language design, although it was not fully backward compatible with Python 2. Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020, and Python 3 has since become the standard. Over the years, Python's simplicity, versatility, and community-driven development have contributed to its widespread adoption across industries, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.

### Why learn Python?

- **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax that is easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
- **Versatile Applications**: Python can be used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more, providing diverse career opportunities.
- **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks**: Python offers a rich set of libraries and frameworks (e.g., Pandas, Django, TensorFlow) that simplify and speed up the development process.
- **Strong Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, which means you can easily find help, tutorials, and resources when learning or solving problems.
- **High Demand in the Job Market**: Python is widely used in many industries, and its popularity continues to grow, leading to a high demand for Python developers and related roles.

## Getting Started

This course is designed in such a way that you will learn the basics of Python and then move towards more advanced topics of Python. To ensure full utilization of this course we encourage you to follow along with the course. We recommend to write the code along with us to ensure complete understanding.

Now lets start this **_exciting journey of Python_**.

## Development Environment

Development is fun when you use the correct set of tools to help you assist along the way. Let's setup the **Development Environment** for Python.

### Python Compiler/ Interpreter

Python is a High Level Language, and it needs a tool that can convert the high level code to machine readable code. For that, we will need a compiler/ interpreter. In order to install the python compiler, [click here](https://www.python.org/).

### Code Editor

Code Editor is program where you will be writing your program. It is one of the most important part of development, and also it determines developer experience.

We recommend **Visual Studio Code ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download/))** for code editor as it is one of the best and feature rich code editor that is used in industry.

### Extensions

**VS Code** provides you with a lot of extensions that you can install to improve developer experience and also to increase the features. The follow are the extensions that we recommend you to install.

- **Prettier** : As a developer you not only have to write functional code but also the code that is easy to understand and easy to understand for other developers. Prettier is a extension that helps to prettify/ format your code so that it is easy on eyes and understandable.

- **Python**: A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported Python versions), providing access points for extensions to seamlessly integrate and offer support for IntelliSense (Pylance), debugging (Python Debugger), formatting, linting, code navigation, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

This is it for the development environment. You can explore more to enhance your code editor and personalize it to be yours.
