Van Rossum began developing Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, aiming to address its limitations while maintaining ease of use. The name \"Python\" was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, reflecting Van Rossum's desire to make programming more enjoyable. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing new features like list comprehensions and garbage collection. In 2008, Python 3.0, a major revision, was launched to fix inconsistencies and improve language design, although it was not fully backward compatible with Python 2. Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020, and Python 3 has since become the standard.
